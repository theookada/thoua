                <p>
                  Hi there!  My name is Theo Okada or “Riesling” on Discord.  Thank you for taking the time to look at THOUA.  I grew up playing D&D 3.5 and Pathfinder and enjoyed being able to have a creative outlet that I could share with friends.  I also enjoyed playing JPRG such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem for the turn-based grid combat.  Additionally, I love MMOs such as Final Fantasy XIV for their raids and community.  So I wanted to combine my favorite aspects of those games into a tabletop system that people new to the genre could try and for vetern players to modify and customize.<br /><br />
                  I hope with THOUA new Players are encouraged to try Tabletops and create experiences and stories that the Players’ and GM can enjoy together.
                </p>

                <h2>Support</h2>
